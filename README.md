# File-base-note-manager
Built a file-based notes app using Node.js and Express. Notes are stored and read directly from the filesystem instead of a database. Implemented routing, form handling, EJS rendering, and async file operations to understand backend fundamentals and real server-side data flow.
NOTE create views folder in which both ejs will go 
create a files folder where your files willl be stored 
create a public folder for your stylesheet ,js and photos
