# File-base-note-manager
A lightweight file-based manager built with Node.js and Express that focuses on raw functionality over polish. It allows creating, viewing, and editing file names directly from the browser while keeping everything simple and transparent. No databases, no abstractions—just filesystem logic, routing, and templating wired together through hands-on problem solving and debugging. This project reflects learning by building, breaking things, and fixing them properly.
